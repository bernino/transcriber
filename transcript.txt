00:00:00 : deep sense - simple machine  
 
 how the economic Machine Works in 30 minutes the economy works like a simple machine but many people don't understand it or they don't agree on how it works and this has led to a lot of needless economic suffering I feel a deep sense of responsibility to share my simple but practical economic template though it's unconventional it has helped me to anticipate and to sidestep the global financial crisis 
 
00:00:30 : simple transactions - economy  
 
 and it just worked well for me for over 30 years let's begin though the economy might seem complex it works in a simple mechanical way it's made up of a few simple parts and a lot of simple transactions that are repeated over and over again a zillion times these transactions are above all else driven by human nature and they create three main forces that drive the economy number one productivity growth number to the show 
 
00:01:00 : term debt cycle - transactions  
 
 the term debt cycle and number three the long-term debt cycle will look at these three forces and Howling them on top of each other creates a good template for tracking economic movements and figuring out what's happening now let's start with the simplest part of the economy transaction and economy is simply the sum of the transactions that make it up and a transaction is a very simple thing you make transactions all the time every time you buy some 
 
00:01:30 : amount - money  
 
 you create a transaction each transaction consists of a buyer exchanging money or credit with a seller for goods services for financial assets credit spin just like money so adding together the money spent and the amount of credit spent you could know the total spending the total amount of spending drives the economy if you divide the amount spent by the quantity sold 
 
00:02:00 : transaction - market  
 
 you get for price and that's it that's our transaction it's the building block of the economic machine all cycles and all forces in an economy are driven by transactions so if we can understand transactions we can understand the whole economy a market consists of all the buyers and all the sellers making transactions for the same thing for example there is a wheat Market a car market the stock market and markets for millions of things 
 
00:02:30 : banks - transactions  
 
 an economy consists of all of the transactions in all of its markets if you add up the total spending and the total quantity sold in all of the markets you have everything you need to know to understand the economy it's just that simple people businesses Banks and governments all engage in transactions the way I just described exchanging money and credit for goods services and financial assets the biggest
